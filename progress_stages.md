## 529 (Mon.)

``` 
1. set up eddie
2. test eddie usage with a script file (not GPU)
```

## 530 (Tues.)

```
1. prepare before restarting the project
```

## 531 (Wed.)

``` 
1. reread the previous progress of the project
2. reread the IPP report
3. reproduce the SASRec again
4. research the implementation of GRU4Rec
```

## 601 (Thur.)

```
1. reproduce GRU4Rec with recSys15 dataset (R@20:0.4833; mrr:0.1477)
2. test Eddie for GPU use (Pytorch)
```

## 604 (Sun.)

```
1. slides preparation
2. reproduce GRU4Rec's dataset splitting strategy
```

# Week 1

## 606(Tues.)

```
1. try Recall@k evaluation metrix
2. understand P90 coverage@k
```

## 607 (Wed.)

```
1. Reread SASRec, Pinnerformer.
Why sampled softmax in Pinnerformer but the P90 coverage still works?
2. Try to implement P90 coverage@k.
```
