Pytorch, GPU
Dataset: 
MovieLens: Movie recommendation
	movies: movie_id title, genres
	links: movie imdb_id tmdb_id
	tags: users tag movie timestamp
	ratings: users movie rate timestamp
 recommend a single item
Retailrocket:
	view---add to cart---transaction


Difference: traditional system recommend a single item, we output a sequence like amazon does.
input,output: input sequence, output sequence.
So this is still a individual project, but each student focuses their own direction, but actually they have something in similar.
Goal:
build a sequence prediction model.

Questions:
what could be the labels? do you have some recommendation?
we can vectorize the input when preparing data.
