**Korres:**

```
1. Make clearer to non-specialist. (e.g dense all action loss function)
2. Avoid strong statement unless with reference(e.g Judgement of a method)
3. A lot of baselines. Start with simple ones. Pay attention on window-based predictor
4. Too many metrics. (R@k, P@k, nDCG@k, InterestEntropy@k); (PinnerFormer choose R@k, InterestEntropy@k)
```

**AMLG**

```
1. Avoid repetition
2. detailed introduction can be explained the difference between SASRec (next step) and PinnerFormer's training process(Dense all action)
3. Next-item prediction cannot sufficiently capture the interest scope. Repeat too much times.
4. A little more introduction on  augmentation would be better.

**David**

```
1. Lack of features of different datasets, some potential influence to the performance
2. Detailed about InterestEntropy@k.
3. Detailed about Data augmentation
