## Abstract

	1. Clarification on the recommender system

## Motivation

1. Addition
2. Clarification, user's previous reference &rarr;Â users' historical sequence
3. More statements (mention SASRec, GRU4Rec)



## 1.1 Problem statement

1. Clarify performance &rarr; accuracy/ computation time/ diversity
2. Again, focus on one topic, 2 major tasks makes the project unclear.
3. Rewrite the main body of this part

## 1.2 Research Hypothesis

1. Change to research question
2. add some information of original 1.1 part  to this part



## 1.3 Timeliness and Novelty

1. paraphrase
2. Detailed about the novelty

## 1.4 Significance

1. remove ChatGPT inspired part
2. Change it to the wide use of recommender in real-life

## 1.5 Feasiblity

1. state we will use models and data from academic literature



## 2 GRU4Rec

1. To make it more serious and academic



## 2 SASRec

1. delete unpractical benefit

## 3 Data handling

1. mention the potential interesting experiments of sequence length.

## 3 Multi-Day window prediction model

1. modification of this part

## 3 Further experiments and Analysis

1. define of temporal likelihood

## 4 Evaluation

1. add diversity metric
2. explicit about different objective between window predictor and next item predictor.
