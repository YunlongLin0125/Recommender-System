1.3 Timeliness and Novelty
1.6 Beneficiaries (focusing more on the customer / user and their experience.)

2. KNN 
	(add a interesing quota)
2. SASRec 
	(add parallel computation intro)

3. Next-item prediction model: 
	1. add some brief evaluation method on different potential modification.
	2. specificy the model to transformer-based (SASRec)
3. Multi-day window prediction model:
	1. add normal case \-> dense all action loss
3. Further experiments:
	clarify 'temporal likelihood'

4. Evaluation: 
	add fair comparison

5. Expected Outcomes:
	+ Specific/clarification
